# Ball Game

Ball Game is an arcade-style game in which the player controls the ball, which moves persistently to the right. The player is tasked with navigating the ball through pairs of obstacles that have equally gaps placed at random heights. Ball automatically descends and only ascends when the player taps the SPACEBAR key. Colliding with the obstacles or the ground ends the gameplay. The goal of the game is to maximize the score which is actually the number of seconds of gameplay without getting collided.
